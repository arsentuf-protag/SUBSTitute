# SUBSTitute
A GUI for mapping directories to virtual drives (see *SUBST* command). It is built on top of **.NET 5.0** and **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sungaila/SUBSTitute/master/Content/1.0.0_Screenshot.png" width="390" alt="Screenshot from version 1.0.0">

While its primary goal is to offer a convenient GUI for the *SUBST* command, I use it as a playground to test C# 8.0, .NET Core and WPF stuff.

At this point I am satisfied with SUBSTitute: There are no major features/changes planned. I still keep an eye on .NET Core updates, though. And I might expand on the easter egg (about dialog) just for fun.
